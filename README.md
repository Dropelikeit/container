PHP DI Container
----------------

A lightweight dependency injection container that is decoupled from any framework.
This library can be used for production, but I recommend that it is better to use a di-container from a larger community like Symfony, Laravel or Laminas.

This library was developed for fun, but is supported if someone uses it.

This project can also be used as an example to show how a modern DI container works in a simplified way.
